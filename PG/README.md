# Proof General â€” Organize your proofs! 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ProofGeneral/PG.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ProofGeneral/PG)

Proof General is a generic Emacs interface for proof assistants.
The aim of the Proof General project is to provide a powerful, generic
environment for using interactive proof assistants.

This is version 4.4.1~pre of Proof General.

## Setup

Remove old versions of Proof General, then download and install the new release from GitHub:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ProofGeneral/PG ~/.emacs.d/lisp/PG
cd ~/.emacs.d/lisp/PG
make
```

Then add the following to your `.emacs`:

```elisp
;; Open .v files with Proof General's Coq mode
(load "~/.emacs.d/lisp/PG/generic/proof-site")
```

If Proof General complains about a version mismatch, make sure that the shell's `emacs` is indeed your usual Emacs. If not, run the Makefile again with an explicit path to Emacs. On macOS in particular you'll probably need something like

```sh
make clean; make EMACS=/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs
```
